─── 90-MINUTE DAILY FLOW ────────────────────────────

CLASS 1–2  (Single group, all students together):
  15m — चला खेळूया (Play):     Circle game, alphabet/number song + movement. Builds energy and social skills.
  15m — चला ऐकुया (Listen):   Teacher reads picture story aloud with expression; 2–3 comprehension questions; every child speaks.
  15m — चला करूया (Do):       Individual task (trace letter / draw number / circle a word); 2 children share aloud.
  45m — TLM Activities:         Groups of 4–5 rotate through: Chitra Cards, Number Stones, Linking Cards, Bundle Sticks, digital simulations.

─── AVAILABLE TLM MATERIALS ─────────────────────────

  • Chitra Cards           — picture + word cards for literacy Levels 1–3; use for matching, sorting, comprehension.
  • Linking Cards          — letter → sound → picture chains; critical for Levels 0–1 to bridge letter and word.
  • Chaudakhadi Chart      — Marathi alphabet reference; every classroom must have one visible.
  • Number Flash Cards     — digit recognition drills for numeracy Levels 0–1; also used for speed challenges.
  • Bundle Sticks (tens)   — physical place-value tool; group 10 sticks into 1 bundle for "tens" concept (Level 2).
  • H-T-O Grid             — Hundreds-Tens-Ones board drawn on blackboard; essential for Level 3.
  • Word Problem Cards     — contextual real-life maths scenarios for Levels 2–3.
  • Basic Stories 1/2/3    — graduated reading booklets for Levels 2–4.
  • Anuched Pustika        — paragraph booklet for Levels 3–4 deep reading.
  • Bal Library Worksheets — take-home reading reinforcement for Levels 2–4.

─── CORE TaRL PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES ───────────────

  1. TEACH AT THE RIGHT LEVEL — Group students by current ASER level, NOT by class/grade. A Class 5 student at Level 1 joins the Level 1 group.
  2. DAILY STRUCTURED FLOW — Every session: Play → Listen → Do → TLM. Never skip the play phase; it sets engagement for the whole session.
  3. SIMULTANEOUS GROUPS — Class 3–4 always runs two groups at the same time. Teacher circulates every 15–20 minutes. Students must be self-sufficient within their group.
  4. GAMES BEFORE DRILLS — Introduce every concept through a game first. Competitive and cooperative games both work; avoid pure drilling.
  5. MANIPULATIVES BEFORE ABSTRACT — Always use physical objects (stones, cards, bundles) before moving to written symbols or printed worksheets.
  6. PEER LEARNING LADDER — Students at higher sub-levels within a group teach lower ones. This consolidates the teacher's learning AND builds confidence.
  7. DAILY MICRO-OBSERVATION — During TLM time, teacher targets 3–4 students per day for 2-minute individual observation. Track movement between ASER levels.
  8. FREQUENCY OVER DURATION — Short daily practice beats long weekly sessions. 90 minutes every day is the core commitment.

─── INTERVENTION RECIPES BY BOTTLENECK ─────────────

  HIGH % AT LITERACY LEVEL 0 (Beginner stuck):
    → Run "Chaudakhadi Relay": 2 teams, one letter called out, first to find it on the chart wins a point.
    → Use Linking Cards daily for 10 minutes — letter sound → picture → word chain.
    → Send Linking Cards home for parent-assisted practice.

  HIGH % AT LITERACY LEVEL 1 (Letter-but-not-word):
    → Word-building game with cut-up Chitra Card letters.
    → Chitra Card sorting: group cards by first letter, then by last letter.
    → Daily 5-minute "read aloud 1 word to a partner" activity.

  HIGH % AT NUMERACY LEVEL 0 (Cannot recognize numbers):
    → Stone counting: scatter 1–9 stones, children pick up the number called.
    → Number song with body: clap N times for each number 1–9.
    → Number Flash Card "fastest hand": flash card, first child to slap the right number wins.

  HIGH % AT NUMERACY LEVEL 1 (Single digit but no operations):
    → Number line jump: physical number line on floor, teacher calls "3 + 2", child jumps.
    → Domino addition: use domino tiles for visual addition.
    → "Market game": pretend shop with stones as coins (max 9).

  LOW ENDLINE IMPROVEMENT (Stagnant cohort):
    → Review group composition — students may have been mis-leveled at baseline.
    → Increase TLM rotation frequency: every 8 minutes instead of 12.
    → Introduce "speed rounds" to build fluency and confidence.
    → Ensure Warm Up game is changed daily to maintain novelty.

─── LEVEL 2 (CLASS 3-5) DEEP DIVE PEDAGOGY (From Manual) ──
  
  LANGUAGE TIME DISTRIBUTION (Level 2):
    • Reading with Comprehension: 20 mins. Connect text to real-life experiences. Avoid mechanical reading.
    • Role Play: 20 mins. Students act out the story. Builds confidence and social-emotional skills.
    • Mind Mapping: 15 mins. Brainstorming vocabulary around a central word (e.g., "Market" -> crowd, shop, money).
    • Independent Writing (Swayam Lekhan): 20 mins. Writing sentences using mind-map words or story extension.
    • Worksheets: 15 mins. Group discussion followed by individual problem solving.

  MATH TIME DISTRIBUTION (Level 2):
    • Math Talk (Ganit Sambandhi Baat-cheet): 10 mins. Discussing math in daily life (market bills, time taken to travel, measuring classroom items).
    • Number Recognition: 10 mins. Using "Sankhya Diary" (Number Diary) and Expansion Charts (1, 10, 100).
    • Basic Operations & Word Problems: 20 mins. Focus on subtraction with borrowing and division. Ask: "What is given? What is asked? What operation is needed?"
    • Small Group Work: 20 mins. E.g., Give 12 matchsticks to a group of 4, ask them to divide equally to teach division concept.

  KEY PRINCIPLES FOR LEVEL 2:
    • Currency Logic: Use fake currency notes (1, 10, 100, 1000) to teach place value, addition, and division (e.g., dividing Rs. 24 among 4 friends requires breaking tens into ones).
    • Zero Concept (Shunya Ka Kamaal): Explicitly teach multiplying by zero using matchstick groups (e.g., 2 groups of zero = 0).
    • Group Tasks: Give a daily real-world group task (e.g., calculate the total weight of the mid-day meal ingredients for the day).
